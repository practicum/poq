(somewhere make sure we mention: TALK ABOUT HOW WHEN THE FORMULA IS INVALID, WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A COUNTEREXAMPLE.)

this is where we can describe the intended usage 'habits'. during development. for 'legacy code'. for 'debugging'.

also 'habits': during interactive development: short answer times for CEX. pattern: "oops. retry. oops. retry. oops. retry. LONG PAUSE... done"

also 'habits': for DEBUGGING: why did we write this? "we wrote it to retrieve..." but INSTEAD what did we get?  we got:
(x,z,y)
(a,z,b)

how could that have happened? well, assert that it cannot happen, get a counter-example from POQ.


explain that precondition can reference 'inputs'. postcondition uses 'inputs' and Q_RESULT.

reiterate that there there are four inputs: query, ddl, pre, post. so when the prover engine shows that the query did not meet the specification, the outcome can be 'repaired' by changing any one of those four inputs.



>> particular example brings up the DATE stuff
